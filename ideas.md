# Idea 1
You control a probe in a 2.5D solar system. You have two resources: Fuel and battery. Fuel just allows you to apply impulse. Your ship flies around with semi-realistic orbital mechanics. Battery constantly drops, but can be replenished by flying through planetary atmospheres. The goal is to survive as long as possible.

Most missions would have some kind of twist:
- Standard: Just survive for as long as possible
- Avoid: Survive for as long as possible while being chased by hostile drones
- Collect: Fly through other orbiting objects. Collects as many as you can!
- Carry: Grab orbiting objects and bring them to the portal.
- Scan: Fly through the middle of gas planets to get something. Do it as many times as you can!
